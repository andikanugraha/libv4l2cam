Making the package
------------------

Add the following line to the end of ~/.bashrc

    source ~/develop/libv4l2cam/ros/setup.sh

pointing to the directory where this ROS package is located

Reload

    . ~/.bashrc

You may need to edit stereocam_broadcast.cpp within the src directory in order to change the device numbers for the cameras and the resolution to be used.

Then make the package as follows:

    rosmake --rosdep-install stereocam


Running the ROS publisher (broadcasting service)
------------------------------------------------

Start ROS:

    roscore

Then in a separate shell begin broadcasting:

    rosrun stereocam stereocam_broadcast

And in another shell you can subscribe to the broadcast:

    rosrun stereocam stereocam_subscribe
