Making the package
------------------

Add the following line to the end of ~/.bashrc

    source ~/develop/libv4l2cam/ros/setup.sh

pointing to the directory where this ROS package is located

Reload

    . ~/.bashrc

You may need to edit stereocam_broadcast.cpp within the src directory in order to change the device numbers for the cameras and the resolution to be used.  Camera parameters are also set within stereocam_subscribe.cpp.

Then make the package as follows:

    rosmake --rosdep-install stereocam


Running the ROS publisher (broadcasting service)
------------------------------------------------

Start ROS:

    roscore

Then in a separate shell begin broadcasting:

    rosrun stereocam stereocam_broadcast _index:=0

And in another shell you can subscribe to the broadcast:

    rosrun stereocam stereocam_subscribe

To check that the images are being published:

    rostopic list

should show /stereo/left/image_raw and /stereo/right/image_raw, and also compressed versions of these.

To enable compressed image transport, for efficient transport of images over networks:

    rosparam set /compressed_listener/image_transport compressed

then restart the broadcast and subscriber.

A disparity map of the type sensor_msgs::Image (one byte per pixel) is also published.  This was used instead of stereo_msgs::DisparityImage because it provides the ability to transport disparity maps efficiently over networks using image_transport.  The disparity value is remapped into a 0-255 range.
